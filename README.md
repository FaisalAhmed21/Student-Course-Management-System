# Student-Course-Management-System

## Abstract

This project introduces a Student Course Management System crafted in EMU 8086 assembly language, offering a streamlined and meticulously structured approach to course registration and management. Designed with a role-based user hierarchy, the system delivers specialized functionalities tailored to both students and advisors, ensuring an intuitive and efficient user experience. Harnessing the power of assembly language, this system exemplifies a low-level, performance-driven solution to address the intricate demands of academic course management. It underscores user-centric design, strict compliance with academic policies, and optimized resource utilization, positioning it as an indispensable asset for educational institutions. This project stands as a testament to the potential of assembly language in delivering sophisticated solutions to complex challenges.

## Key Features

1) Role-based user (Student/Advisor).

2) Student course limit based on CGPA (5 courses for 3.5 or 3.5+ cgpa and 4 courses for less than 3.5 cgpa students).

3) Seat number (If no seat is available, the student will not be able to add that course but the advisor will be able to add that course).

4) Advisor can check the student's course history.

5) Students cannot drop but add courses, but advisors can add or drop courses.

6) Students can see their semester fee after completing the course registration.

## How to run the project

1) Install EMU 8086 in the laptop/PC.
  
2) Download the zip file of asm version of the project.

3) Open the asm file in EMU 8086 and click on the emulate option, after the assembler process the code click on the run option.
